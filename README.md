Leather is the most popular animal ingredient. Mostly Leather is made from cowhide as it is
reasonably easy to get in big numbers and its thick characteristics make it useful for a wide range of
applications. India is the world's subsequent major exporter of leather goods and the fourth largest
exporter of leather goods in the world. Leather is a natural and strong material created by tanning
animal skins and skins. Leather pricing is subjective because it is highly dependent on quality. of the
leather and the condition of surface imperfections. Before the mass manufacture of certain goods,
there was little work to detect leather defects. But it's annoying because it's labor-intensive,
time-consuming, eye strain, and often prone to human error. A manual error checking process is
essential in the leather manufacturing industry as a quality control step. This paper proposes a fully
automatic defect detection system that uses a convolutional neural network on the finished leather to
provide defect-free leather. The camera then accumulates a picture of the leather, trains and tests the
image using a deep learning architecture. The histogram gradient preprocessing has been introduced to
improve the quality of the leather image to maintain the display of important features from a
perceptibility viewpoint. After that convolutional neural network classifiers are used to distinguish
Between a defective leather area and a non- defective leather area. The proposed method can generate
a significant accuracy rate from the 1100 leather patch sample collection.

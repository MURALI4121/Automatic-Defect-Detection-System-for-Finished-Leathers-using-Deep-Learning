# Automatic-Defect-Detection-System-for-Finished-Leathers-using-Deep-Learning 
# MAJOR PROJECT
Purpose - This Purpose of this paper is to focus on the fully automatic defect detection system that uses a convolutional
neural network on the finished leather to provide defect-free leather.

Design/methodology/approach - The camera then accumulates a sample of the leather, trains and tests the image using a
deep learning architecture. The histogram gradient preprocessing has been introduced to improve the quality of the leather
image to maintain the display of important features from a perceptibility viewpoint. After that convolutional neural network
classifiers are used to distinguish Between a defective leather area and a non- defective leather area.

Findings - Leather is a natural and strong material created by tanning animal skins and skins. Leather pricing is subjective
because it is highly dependent on quality. of the leather and the condition of surface imperfections. Before the mass
manufacture of certain goods, there was little work to detect leather defects. But it's annoying because it's labor-intensive,
time-consuming, eye strain, and often prone to human error. A manual error checking process is essential in the leather
manufacturing industry as a quality control step.

Originality/value - The proposed method can generate a significant accuracy rate from the 1100 leather patch sample
collection.
